**Steps to Increase Volume Size of EC2 Linux Instance:**

**a.** **Snapshot Backup:**

Before Modifying the Volume size, we take Snapshot backup. In case if something goes wrong while modifying the volume. We can create new volume out of that snapshot and attach it to the instance.

i. Navigate to EC2 Console.

ii. Click on Volume.

iii. Select the Volume for which you want to increase the size and Click on Actions and Select Create Snapshots.

iv. Provide Description and Add tags and Click on Create Snapshots.

iii. Execute below command to list all the filesystems mounted on your disk.

df -h

iv. To lists information about all available or the specified block devices, use below command.

- **sudo growpart /dev/nvme0n1 1**
