**Project Level:**Â Easy

**Project Description:**

In this project, We are going to leverage the power of Terraform Provisioners and AWS to create an automated and consistent deployment pipeline for applications on Amazon EC2 instances. This project is an automation solution designed to simplify the deployment of applications on AWS EC2 instances. In this project, I am going to deploy a simple flask application.

**Project Level:**Â Intermediate

**Project Description**

This project aims to create a robust highly available web application infrastructure using a two-tier architecture on Amazon Web Services (AWS). The architecture comprises a web tier that handles user requests and a database tier for data storage. I leveraged Terraform for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to provision and manage AWS resources efficiently.

**Project Level:**Â Between Intermediate and Hard

**Project Description ðŸ“„**

This project automates the deployment of a high-availability AWS architecture using Terraform and Jenkins. The architecture consists of an Auto Scaling Group and an Application Load Balancer, all deployed within a separate VPC.

The project is divided into two parts:

- Part 1: Committing Terraform configuration code HCL in GitHub.
- Part 2: Deploying the application to the AWS infrastructure using Jenkins through the HCL code in GitHub.

**Project Level:**Â Expert

**Project Description:**

Deploy a scalable and resilient multi-tier architecture on AWS using Terraform.

**Project Overview**

This project allows us to deploy a highly available, scalable, and secure multi-tier architecture on Amazon Web Services (AWS) using Terraform. The architecture consists of the following three tiers:

- **Web Tier:**Â This tier handles incoming user requests and can be horizontally scaled for increased capacity. It typically includes web servers and a load balancer for distributing traffic.
- **Application Tier:**Â Application servers run our business logic and interact with the database tier. They can also be horizontally scaled to meet demand.
- **Database Tier:**Â The database stores and manages our application data. In this architecture, we use Amazon RDS for a managed database service.
