**Overview**

The majority of contemporary IT companies now include cloud data storage as a fundamental component. Using Amazon S3, we can always upload and download files in a secure manner.

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers.

Amazon S3 is an object storage service that stores data as objects in buckets. Amazon S3 provides administrative features that let you streamline, organize, and configure access to your data to meet your specific business, organizational, and compliance needs.

For a range of use cases, customers of all sizes and sectors can utilize Amazon S3 to store and protect any quantity of data, including big data analytics, enterprise applications, IoT devices, websites, mobile applications, backup & recovery, archiving, and data lakes.
